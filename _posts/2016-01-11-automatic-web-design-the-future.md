# Automatic Web Design - The Future? 

For a long time now, I've been looking for technology that would enable me to write more. I used to do lots of writing, but somehow the overhead of it caught up with me. Blog sites used to require maintenance back when I ran them myself, and then new systems started becoming available that meant less work for myself - but who transfers content? Who makes sure that the old Google links were still active and doing what they should? Well... nobody, as it turned out. And at some point this became so much of a concern that I lost the motivation to keep adding content. Sad but true...

Now, there's no solution I've found so far to this problem. I'd love to be able to save all the content I wrote for [my blog][0] in the past. Many other sites link to it and there are lots and lots of frequent visitors. If only I had more time... the usual thing. 

But now here's a new thing: The Grid. And it promises to take over the web design for a site. Now that's interesting! And because I'm lazy, I haven't had time to really check out what to expect from this thing - learning by doing is going to be the approach of choice here. So this is the first post, and hopefully there'll be many more. I'm wondering if this will be a place to blog... or perhaps more like a professional website? We'll see.
